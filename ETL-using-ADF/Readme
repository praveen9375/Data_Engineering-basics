In this sample data engineering project, we performed out ETL Operation in our dataset of employees using Azure Data Factory.
We created a data factory and azure blob storage, linked them with each other. Then we uploaded our dataset from the blobstorage to the factory.
This project is focused around the extraction of the employees working in the IT department of the company. Then we created a pipeline which reads the data from
the proj-source container and on the completion of the work, uploads in the "Prod" container. We used the azure expressions to extract the data.
